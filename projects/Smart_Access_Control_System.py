"""Challenge: Smart Access Control System
You're designing the entry logic for a secure building.
People should be allowed entry only if they meet the following rules:

üõ°Ô∏è Entry Rules:
If the person is an employee and has a valid badge, they may enter.

If they are a guest, they must be on the approved guest list and must not be banned.

Anyone else is denied access.
